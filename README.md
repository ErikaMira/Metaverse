## Understanding the Metaverse

The metaverse is a virtual, shared, and interconnected space that brings together users from around the world, providing a unique and immersive digital experience. It is a collective virtual universe that combines augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the internet, blurring the boundaries between physical and digital realms.
